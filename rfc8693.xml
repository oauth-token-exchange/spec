      <t>
  A security token is a set of information that facilitates the sharing of
  identity and security information in heterogeneous environments or across
  security domains.  Examples of security tokens include JSON Web Tokens
  (JWTs) <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/> and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
  2.0 assertions <xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os" format="default"/>.  Security tokens are
  typically signed to achieve integrity and sometimes also encrypted to
  achieve confidentiality.  Security tokens are also sometimes described as
  assertions, such as in <xref target="RFC7521" format="default"/>.
</t>
      <t>
  A Security Token Service (STS) is a service capable of validating
  security tokens provided to it and issuing new security tokens in
  response, which enables clients to obtain appropriate
  access credentials for resources in heterogeneous environments or across security
  domains.
  Web Service clients have used WS-Trust <xref target="WS-Trust" format="default"></xref>
  as the protocol to interact with an STS for token exchange.
  While WS-Trust
  uses XML and SOAP, the trend in modern Web development
  has been towards RESTful (Representational State Transfer) patterns and JSON.
  The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework <xref target="RFC6749" format="default"></xref>
  and OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens <xref target="RFC6750" format="default"></xref>
  have emerged as popular standards for authorizing third-party
  applications' access to HTTP and RESTful resources.
  The conventional OAuth 2.0 interaction involves the exchange of some
  representation of resource owner authorization for an access token,
  which has proven to be an extremely useful pattern in practice. However,
  its input and output are somewhat too constrained as is to fully
  accommodate a security token exchange framework.
</t>
      <t>
  This specification defines a protocol extending OAuth 2.0 that enables
  clients to request and obtain security tokens from authorization servers acting in
  the role of an STS.
  Similar to OAuth 2.0, this specification focuses on client developer simplicity and
  requires only an HTTP client and JSON parser, which are nearly universally available
  in modern development environments. The STS protocol defined in this specification
  is not itself RESTful (an STS doesn't lend itself particularly well to a REST
  approach) but does utilize communication patterns and data formats that should be
  familiar to developers accustomed to working with RESTful systems.
</t>
      <t>
  A new grant type for a token exchange request and the associated specific parameters for
  such a request to the token endpoint are defined by this specification.
  A token exchange response is a normal OAuth 2.0 response from the token endpoint
  with a few additional parameters defined herein to provide information to the client.
</t>
      <t>
  The entity that makes the request to exchange tokens is considered the client in the
  context of the token exchange interaction. However, that does not restrict
  usage of this profile to traditional OAuth clients. An OAuth resource server, for example, might assume
  the role of the client during token exchange in order to trade an
  access token that it received in a protected resource request for
  a new token that is appropriate to include in a call to a backend
  service. The new token might be an access token that is more
  narrowly scoped for the downstream service or it could be an entirely different kind
  of token.
</t>
      <t>
  The scope of this specification is limited to the definition of a
  basic request-and-response protocol for an STS-style token exchange utilizing OAuth 2.0.
  Although a few new JWT claims are defined that enable delegation semantics to be expressed,
  the specific syntax, semantics, and security characteristics of the tokens themselves
  (both those presented to the authorization server and those obtained by the client)
  are explicitly out of scope, and no requirements are placed on the trust model in
  which an implementation might be deployed. Additional profiles may provide
  more detailed requirements around the specific nature of the parties and trust involved,
  such as whether signing and/or encryption of tokens is needed or if proof-of-possession-style
  tokens will be required or issued. However, such details
  will often be policy decisions made with respect to the specific needs of individual
  deployments and will be configured or implemented accordingly.
</t>
      <t>
  The security tokens obtained may be used in a number of contexts,
  the specifics of which are also beyond the scope of this specification.
</t>
      <section anchor="DelegationImpersonation" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Delegation vs. Impersonation Semantics</name>
        <t>
    One common use case for an STS (as alluded to in the previous section)
    is to allow a resource server A to make calls to a backend service C on
    behalf of the requesting user B.  Depending on the local site policy and
    authorization infrastructure, it may be desirable for A to use its own
    credentials to access C along with an annotation of some form that A is
    acting on behalf of B ("delegation") or for A to be granted a limited access
    credential to C but that continues to identify B as the authorized
    entity ("impersonation").  Delegation and impersonation can be useful
    concepts in other scenarios involving multiple participants as well.
        </t>
        <t>
    When principal A impersonates principal B, A is given all
    the rights that B has within some defined rights context
    and is indistinguishable from B in that context.
    Thus, when principal A impersonates principal B, then insofar
    as any entity receiving such a token is concerned, they are
    actually dealing with B. It is true that some members of the
    identity system might have awareness that impersonation is
    going on, but it is not a requirement.
    For all intents and purposes, when A is impersonating B, A is B within the
    context of the rights authorized by the token. A's ability to impersonate B could
    be limited in scope or time, or even with a one-time-use restriction,
    whether via the contents of the token or an out-of-band mechanism.
        </t>
        <t>
    Delegation semantics are different than
    impersonation semantics, though the two are closely related.
    With delegation semantics, principal A still has its own identity
    separate from B, and it is explicitly understood that while B
    may have delegated some of its rights to A, any actions taken are
    being taken by A representing B. In a sense, A is an agent for B.
        </t>
        <t>
    Delegation and impersonation are not inclusive of all situations.
    When a principal is acting directly on its own behalf, for example,
    neither delegation nor impersonation are in play. They are, however,
    the more common semantics operating for token exchange and, as such, are
    given more direct treatment in this specification.
        </t>
        <t>
    Delegation semantics are typically expressed in a token by including information about both the
    primary subject of the token as well as the actor to whom that subject has delegated some of its rights.
    Such a token is sometimes referred to as a composite token because it is composed of information
    about multiple subjects. Typically, in the request, the <tt>subject_token</tt>
    represents the identity of the party on
    behalf of whom the token is being requested while the <tt>actor_token</tt> represents
    the identity of the party to whom the access rights of the issued token are being delegated.
    A composite token issued by the authorization server will contain information about both parties.
    When and if a composite token is issued is at the discretion of the authorization server and
    applicable policy and configuration.
        </t>
        <t>
    The specifics of representing a composite token and even whether or not
    such a token will be issued depend on the details of the implementation
    and the kind of token.  The representations of composite tokens that are
    not JWTs are beyond the scope of this specification.  The <tt>actor_token</tt> request parameter, however, does provide
    a means for providing information about the desired actor, and the JWT
    <tt>act</tt> claim can provide a representation of a
    chain of delegation.

  A client requests a security token by making a token request to the authorization

  in <xref target="RFC6749" sectionFormat="of" section="4.5"/>.
</t>
        <t>
  Client authentication to the authorization server is done using the normal
  mechanisms provided by OAuth 2.0.
  <xref target="RFC6749" sectionFormat="of" section="2.3.1"/>
  defines password-based authentication of the client,
  however, client authentication is extensible and other mechanisms are possible.
  For example, <xref target="RFC7523" format="default"/> defines client authentication using bearer
  JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/>.
  The supported methods of client authentication and whether or not to allow
  unauthenticated or unidentified clients are deployment decisions that are
  at the discretion of the authorization server.
  Note that omitting client authentication allows
  for a compromised token to be leveraged via an STS into other tokens by
  anyone possessing the compromised token. Thus, client
  authentication allows for additional authorization checks by the STS as to which
  entities are permitted to impersonate or receive delegations from other
  entities.
</t>
        <t>
  The client makes a token exchange request to the token endpoint with an extension
  grant type using the HTTP <tt>POST</tt> method. The
  following parameters are included in the HTTP request entity-body
  using the <tt>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</tt>
  format with a character encoding of UTF-8 as described in
  <xref target="RFC6749" sectionFormat="of" section="B"/>.

          <dd>
    <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.
    A URI that indicates the target service or resource where the client intends to use
    the requested security token. This enables the authorization server to apply policy as appropriate
    for the target, such as determining the type and content of the token to be issued or if and how
    the token is to be encrypted.
    In many cases, a client will not have knowledge of the logical organization of the systems with
    which it interacts and will only know a URI of the service where it intends to use the token.
    The <tt>resource</tt> parameter allows the client to indicate to the authorization server
    where it intends to use the issued token by providing the location, typically as an https URL, in the
    token exchange request in the same form that will be used to access that resource.
    The authorization server will typically have the capability to map from a resource URI value to
    an appropriate policy. The value of the <tt>resource</tt> parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be an
    absolute URI, as specified by <xref target="RFC3986"
    sectionFormat="of" section="4.3"/>,
    that <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include a query component and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include a fragment component.
    Multiple <tt>resource</tt> parameters may be used to indicate
    that the issued token is intended to be used at the multiple resources listed.
    See <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-resource-indicators" format="default"/> for additional
    background and uses of the <tt>resource</tt> parameter.
  </dd>
          <dt>audience</dt>
          <dd>
    <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.  The logical name of the target service where the client intends
    to use the requested security token. This serves a purpose similar to the
    <tt>resource</tt> parameter but with the client
    providing a logical name for the target service. Interpretation of the
    name requires that the value be something that both the client and the
    authorization server understand. An OAuth client identifier, a SAML entity
    identifier <xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os" format="default"/>, and an OpenID Connect
    Issuer Identifier <xref target="OpenID.Core" format="default"/> are examples of things that
    might be used as <tt>audience</tt> parameter values.
    However, <tt>audience</tt> values used with a given
    authorization server must be unique within that server to ensure that
    they are properly interpreted as the intended type of value.  Multiple
    <tt>audience</tt> parameters may be used to indicate
    that the issued token is intended to be used at the multiple audiences
    listed.  The <tt>audience</tt> and <tt>resource</tt> parameters may be used together to indicate
    multiple target services with a mix of logical names and resource URIs.

    sectionFormat="of" section="3.3"/>, that allow the client to specify the desired scope of
    the requested security token in the context of the service or resource
    where the token will be used. The values and associated semantics of scope
    are service specific and expected to be described in the relevant service
    documentation.</dd>

    <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.
    An identifier, as described in <xref target="TokenTypeIdentifiers" format="default"/>, for the type of the requested security token.
    If the requested type is unspecified, the issued token type is at
    the discretion of the authorization server and may be dictated by
    knowledge of the requirements of the service or resource
    indicated by the <tt>resource</tt> or
    <tt>audience</tt> parameter.
  </dd>
          <dt>subject_token</dt>
          <dd>
    <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>.
    A security token that represents the
    identity of the party on behalf of whom the request is being made.
    Typically, the subject of this token will be the subject of
    the security token issued in response to the request.
  </dd>
          <dt>subject_token_type</dt>
          <dd>
    <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>.
    An identifier, as described in <xref target="TokenTypeIdentifiers" format="default"/>, that indicates the type of the security token in
    the <tt>subject_token</tt> parameter.
  </dd>
          <dt>actor_token</dt>
          <dd>
    <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.
    A security token that represents
    the identity of the acting party. Typically, this will be the party that is authorized to use the requested security token and act on behalf of the subject.
  </dd>
          <dt>actor_token_type</dt>
          <dd>
    An identifier, as described in <xref target="TokenTypeIdentifiers" format="default"/>, that indicates the type of the security token in the
    <tt>actor_token</tt> parameter.
    This is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> when the <tt>actor_token</tt> parameter
    is present in the request but <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be included otherwise.
  </dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
  In processing the request, the authorization server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform the appropriate validation procedures for the indicated token
  type and, if the actor token is present, also
  perform the appropriate validation procedures for its indicated token type.
  The validity criteria and details of any particular token are beyond the scope of
  this document and are specific to the respective type of token and its content.
</t>
        <t>
  In the absence of one-time-use or other semantics specific to the token type, the act of performing
  a token exchange has no impact on the validity of the subject token or actor token.
  Furthermore, the exchange is a one-time event and does not create a tight linkage
  between the input and output tokens, so that (for example) while the expiration
  time of the output token may be influenced by that of the input token,
  renewal or extension of the input token is not expected to be reflected in
  the output token's properties.  It may still be appropriate or desirable to propagate
  token-revocation events. However, doing so is not a general property of the STS
  protocol and would be specific to a particular implementation, token type, or deployment.
</t>
        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Relationship between Resource, Audience, and Scope</name>
          <t>
          When requesting a token, the client can indicate the desired target
          service(s) where it intends to use that token by way of the <tt>audience</tt> and <tt>resource</tt> parameters as well as indicate the
          desired scope of the requested token using the <tt>scope</tt> parameter.

          The semantics of such a request are that the client is asking for a token with the requested
          scope that is usable at all the requested target services. Effectively, the requested access rights of
          the token are the Cartesian product of all the scopes at all the target services.
          </t>
          <t>
          An authorization server may be unwilling or unable to fulfill any token request, but the likelihood
          of an unfulfillable request is significantly higher when very broad access rights are being solicited.
          As such, in the absence of specific knowledge about the relationship of systems in a deployment,
          clients should exercise discretion in the breadth of the access requested, particularly the
          number of target services. An authorization server can use the <tt>invalid_target</tt>
          error code, defined in <xref target="ErrorResponse" format="default"/>, to inform a client that it requested access to
          too many target services simultaneously.

  The authorization server responds to a token exchange request with a normal

  The <tt>access_token</tt> parameter from

  access token issued, as specified in <xref target="RFC6749"

  It provides the client with information about how to utilize the access
  token to access protected resources.  For example, a value of <tt>Bearer</tt>, as specified in <xref target="RFC6750" format="default"/>,
  indicates that the issued security token is a bearer token and the client
  can simply present it as is without any additional proof of eligibility
  beyond the contents of the token itself.  Note that the meaning of this
  parameter is different from the meaning of the <tt>issued_token_type</tt> parameter, which declares the
  representation of the issued security token; the term "token type" is more
  typically used to mean the structural or syntactical representation of the security token, as it is in all <tt>*_token_type</tt> parameters in this specification.  If the
  issued token is not an access token or usable as an access token, then the

  to inspect the content of the token, and this parameter provides a consistent and token-type-agnostic
  indication of how long the token can be expected to be valid.
  For example, the value 1800 denotes that the token will

  A refresh token will typically not be issued when the exchange is of one temporary
  credential (the subject_token) for a different temporary credential (the issued token)
  for use in some other context.
  A refresh token can be issued in cases where the client of the token exchange needs the
  ability to access a resource even when the original credential is no longer valid
  (e.g., user-not-present or offline scenarios where there is no longer any user entertaining
  an active session with the client).
  Profiles or deployments of this specification should clearly document the conditions
  under which a client should expect a refresh token in response to
  <tt>urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange</tt>
  grant type requests.

  parameters of the request and the <tt>issued_token_type</tt> member of the response.
  Token type identifiers are URIs.
  Token exchange can work with both tokens issued by other parties and tokens from

  the syntax (e.g., JWT or SAML 2.0) so the authorization server can parse it; for the latter, it indicates
  what the given authorization server issued it for (e.g., <tt>access_token</tt> or <tt>refresh_token</tt>).

  The value <tt>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt</tt>, which is defined in

</t>
      <t>
  The distinction between an access token and a JWT is subtle.
  An access token represents a delegated authorization decision, whereas JWT is a token format.
  An access token can be formatted as a JWT but doesn't necessarily have to be. And a
  JWT might well be an access token, but not all JWTs are access tokens.

  The intent of this specification is that <tt>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token</tt>
  be an indicator that the token is a typical OAuth access token issued by the authorization server in question, opaque to the client,
  and usable the same manner as any other access token obtained from that authorization server.
  (It could well be a JWT, but the client isn't and needn't be aware of that fact.)
  Whereas, <tt>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt</tt> is to indicate specifically that a JWT is
  being requested or sent (perhaps in a cross-domain use case where the JWT is used as an authorization grant to
  obtain an access token from a different authorization server as is facilitated by <xref target="RFC7523" format="default"/>).
</t>
      <t>
  Note that for tokens that are binary in nature, the URI used for conveying them
  needs to be associated with the semantics of a base64 or other
  encoding suitable for usage with HTTP and OAuth.

      <name>JSON Web Token Claims and Introspection Response Parameters</name>
      <t>
   It is useful to have defined mechanisms to express delegation within a
   token as well as to express authorization to delegate or
   impersonate. Although the token exchange protocol described herein can be
   used with any type of token, this section defines claims to express such
   semantics specifically for JWTs and in an OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection <xref target="RFC7662"
   format="default"></xref> response.  Similar
   definitions for other types of tokens are possible but beyond the scope of
   this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
   Note that the claims not established herein but used in examples and descriptions,
   such as <tt>iss</tt>, <tt>sub</tt>,
   <tt>exp</tt>, etc., are defined by <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <section anchor="actor" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>"act" (Actor) Claim</name>
        <t>
      The <tt>act</tt> (actor) claim provides a means
      within a JWT to express that delegation has occurred and identify the
      acting party to whom authority has been delegated.  The <tt>act</tt> claim value is a JSON object, and members in
      the JSON object are claims that identify the actor.  The claims that
      make up the <tt>act</tt> claim identify and possibly
      provide additional information about the actor.  For example, the
      combination of the two claims <tt>iss</tt> and <tt>sub</tt> might be necessary to uniquely identify an
      actor.
        </t>
        <t>
      However, claims within the <tt>act</tt> claim pertain only to the identity of the actor
      and are not relevant to the validity of the containing JWT in the same manner as the top-level claims.
      Consequently, non-identity claims (e.g., <tt>exp</tt>, <tt>nbf</tt>,
      and <tt>aud</tt>) are not meaningful when used within an
      <tt>act</tt> claim and are therefore not used.

      A chain of delegation can be expressed by nesting one <tt>act</tt> claim within
      another. The outermost <tt>act</tt> claim represents the current actor while nested
      <tt>act</tt> claims represent prior actors. The least recent actor is the most deeply
      nested. The nested <tt>act</tt> claims
      serve as a history trail that connects the initial request and subject
      through the various delegation steps undertaken before reaching the
      current actor.  In this sense, the current actor is considered to
      include the entire authorization/delegation history, leading naturally
      to the nested structure described here.
        </t>
        <t>
      For the purpose of applying access control policy, the consumer of a token <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only consider the token's
      top-level claims and the party identified as the current actor by the <tt>act</tt>
      claim. Prior actors identified by any nested <tt>act</tt> claims are
      informational only and are not to be considered in access control decisions.

        The following example in <xref target="acts-ex" format="default"/> illustrates nested <tt>act</tt> (actor) claims within a JWT Claims Set.

        that the system &lt;https://service16.example.com&gt; is the current actor and &lt;https://service77.example.com&gt; was a prior actor.
        Such a token might come about as the result of service16 receiving a token in a call from service77
        and exchanging it for a token suitable to call service26 while the authorization server
        notes the situation in the newly issued token.

      <tt>actor_token</tt>) is authorized to engage in the requested delegation or
      impersonation.
      The claim value is a JSON object, and members in the JSON object are claims that identify the party that
      is asserted as being eligible to act for the party identified by
      the JWT containing the claim.
      The claims that make up the <tt>may_act</tt>

        security issues.  Any time one principal is delegated the rights of
        another principal, the potential for abuse is a concern.  The use of
        the <tt>scope</tt> claim (in addition to other
        typical constraints such as a limited token lifetime) is suggested to
        mitigate potential for such abuse, as it restricts the contexts in
        which the delegated rights can be exercised.

        Tokens employed in the context of the functionality described herein
        may contain privacy-sensitive information and, to prevent
        disclosure of such information to unintended parties, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be
        transmitted over encrypted channels, such as Transport Layer Security
        (TLS).  In cases where it is desirable to prevent disclosure of certain
        information to the client, the token <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be encrypted to its
        intended recipient. Deployments <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> determine the minimally necessary
        amount of data and only include such information in issued tokens.
        In some cases, data minimization may include representing only an
        anonymous or pseudonymous user.

<!-- [rfced]  We have included some specific questions about the IANA text in
the document. In addition to responding to those questions, please review all of
the IANA-related updates carefully and let us know if any updates are needed.

a) In Section 7.2, the "Paramenter usage location" and "Specification
documents(s)" are different in the document and the registry for the following
entry. It seems that this entry in the registry was updated per
draft-ietf-oauth-resource-indicators-08 (currently in the RFC Editor
queue). Please review and let us know if any updates are needed in either the
document or registry.
 
IANA registry at
https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#parameters:
   o  Parameter name: resource
   o  Parameter usage location: authorization request, token request
   o  Change controller: IESG
   o  Specification document(s): [RFC-ietf-oauth-resource-indicators-08]

This document:
   o  Parameter name: resource
   o  Parameter usage location: token request
   o  Change controller: IESG
   o  Specification document(s): Section 2.1 of RFC 8693

b) In Section 7.6, the "Error Usage Location", "Related Protocol Extension",
"Change Controller", and "Specification Document(s)" are different in the
document and the registry for the following entry. Again, it seems that this
entry in the registry was updated per draft-ietf-oauth-resource-indicators-08
(currently in the RFC Editor queue). Please review and let us know if any
updates are needed in either the document or the registry.

        In the following token exchange request, a client is requesting a token
        with impersonation semantics (delegation is impossible with only a <tt>subject_token</tt>
        and no <tt>actor_token</tt>).
        The client tells the authorization server that it needs a token for use at
        the target service with the logical name
	<tt>urn:example:cooperation-context</tt>.
